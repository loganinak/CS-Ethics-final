<h2>Purpose</h2>
This project was made to help me and other students how password security works. Thoughout this project I created a brute force password cracker that was made to help others understand how easily short passwords are broken. I also did research on how passwords are stored and checked on a server, but still secure so that they are not available to hackers.

<h2>Findings</h2>
The reason passwords containing only words are so easy to guess stems from the fact that people can be easily predicted, to a certain degree of course. This allows brute force hackers to start guessing passwords containing words that I often use in say facebook posts or use words based on videos I watch online. For example for me the program these hackers use might start by guessing words like 'pokemon' or 'Doctor Who'. There are various programs available for hacking people's password but the one mentioned the most is a program called Hydra, in fact it has its own public github page <a href="https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra">here</a>. This program is signifigantly more advanced than mine, but unfortunately I did not feel safe downloading it as it was marked as spyware by my antivirus software.

<h2>How to use</h2>
This project not only contains a simple website that will crack your passwords and time how long it took, but also has a wealth of information in the wiki that will help you learn about how your passwords are handled by servers and how you can make your passwords more secure.
